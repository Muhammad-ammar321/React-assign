                You can use Windster for an unlimited amount of projects, whether
                it's a personal website, a SaaS app, or a website for a client. As
                long as you don't build a product that will directly compete with
                Windster either as a UI kit, theme, or template, it's fine.

                Although both Windster and Tailwind UI are built for integration
                with Tailwind CSS, the main difference is in the design, the pages,
                the extra components and UI elements that Windster includes.

                and later it will include both the application, marketing, and

            <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">

                Generally, it is accepted to use Windster in open-source projects,
                as long as it is not a UI library, a theme, a template, a
                page-builder that would be considered as an alternative to Windster
                itself.
